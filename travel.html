            <p>Yellowstone National Park, a natural marvel, is predominantly located in the U.S. state of Wyoming, though it also extends into Montana and Idaho. This expansive park, renowned as the first national park in the world, was established in 1872. It spans over 2.2 million acres, making it larger than the states of Rhode Island and Delaware combined. The park's diverse landscape ranges from canyons and alpine rivers to lush forests, hot springs, and gushing geysers, including its most famous, Old Faithful.</p>
            <p>The park is situated atop a volcanic hotspot, shaping its unique geothermal features and dramatic scenery. It's nestled in the Rocky Mountains, with elevations from 5,282 to 11,358 feet. The region experiences a complex climate, influencing its varied ecosystems. Yellowstone serves as a refuge for a wide array of wildlife, including grizzly bears, wolves, and herds of bison and elk. Its rich history, stunning natural beauty, and ecological significance make it a cherished destination for nature lovers and outdoor enthusiasts worldwide.</p>
